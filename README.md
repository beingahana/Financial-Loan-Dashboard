## üí° Key Insights

- **High-Risk Borrowers:** Customers in the high-risk credit score category form a disproportionately large share of defaulted loans, signaling a critical risk segment for the lender.  
- **Employment Status & Defaults:** Self-employed individuals exhibit higher default rates compared to salaried employees, indicating the need for stricter eligibility checks or adjusted loan terms for this group.  
- **Loan Type Performance:** Certain loan categories have higher default percentages despite smaller overall volumes, suggesting targeted portfolio monitoring is necessary.  
- **Portfolio Stability:** The majority of active loans fall within low to very low risk categories, highlighting overall portfolio health but also masking isolated high-risk clusters.  
- **Repayment & Affordability Trends:** Interest rates vary significantly across income groups, with higher rates correlating to slower repayment patterns among lower-income customers.
